# 📖 Awesome Books <a name="about-project"></a>
<br>
<br>
The Awesome Books project, created by me and my friend Mohammad Yaser, showcases our skills and knowledge gained throughout our studies. This web-page demonstrates our critical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and research skills. It provides a book collection management system where users can add and remove books. The dynamically updated display allows users to visualize their collection effectively. By utilizing technologies like JavaScript ES6, HTML, CSS, and localStorage, we have created an intuitive and efficient user interface. The Awesome Books project reflects our collaborative teamwork and commitment to continuous learning.
